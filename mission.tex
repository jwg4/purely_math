\chapter{About \emph{purely math}}
A lot of school and early university math tries to simplify calculus and related material by breaking it into small concepts which can be easily understood. The problem with this approach is that math is not made up of a large number of unrelated topics. All math is linked, and a lot of it very closely linked. If we ignore these links, math can seem like it is made up of ever higher stacks of rules and methods to learn, and different types of questions to carry out. At some point the student starts to feel like his or her brain is about to fill up.

The purely math concept is that we put up with many of the concepts being difficult, but try to make the material simple by treating it in a unified way, instead of as lots of bitesize pieces. Rather than patronize students, we give you the hard stuff, and expect you to skip the parts that don't help you.

We also try to give you the opportunity to understand math the way mathematicians do, by discussing as we go along the way that mathematics is constructed by mathematicians, and, we hope, by making the material accessible enough that you will be able to explore it for yourself.
